# GraphZahl Fluent Support
A set of extensions that allow to use [Fluent](https://github.com/vapor/fluent) APIs and Types with [GraphZahl](https://github.com/nerdsupremacist/GraphZahl)

## About GraphZahl

GraphZahl is a Framework to implement Declarative, Type-Safe GraphQL Server APIs with Magic ðŸŽ©.

## Installation
### Swift Package Manager

You can install graphzahl-fluent-support via [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) by adding the following line to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    [...]
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/nerdsupremacist/graphzahl-fluent-support.git", majorVersion: XYZ)
    ]
)
```

## Usage


To use Fluent Types and Models in your API, you can use [graphzahl-fluent-support](https://github.com/nerdsupremacist/graphzahl-fluent-support):

```swift
enum API: GraphQLSchema {
    typealias ViewerContext = Database

    class Query: QueryType {
        let database: Database

        // QueryBuilders are supported with additional paging API
        func todos() -> QueryBuilder<Todo> {
            return Todo.query(on: database)
        }

        required init(viewerContext database: Database) {
            self.database = database
        }
    }
    
    ...
}
```

It adds support for:

- QueryBuilder<T>
- @Parent
- @Children
- @Siblings
- @Field
- @ID
  
  ## Known Issues

- Relation Fields depend on some query builder having run before, or they will crash otherwise. This is not ideal and should be solved
- Paging for queries is not implemented yet
